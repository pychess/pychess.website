<h3>New website.</h3>
<p>After the previous owners of pychess.org decided to graciously hand over their domain to the PyChess project,
we started working on a new and better website.
<a href="http://pychess.googlepages.com" title="Old PyChess Homepage">Our previous page</a> (which may or may not be taken down soon), never really recovered from Googles switch from "pages" to "sites".
Instead, for the new site, we decided to go with <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org" title="nanoc website">nanoc</a>
which has until now proved itself very usable.</p>
<p>After some great coding by Andrew Nagi, and some designing by Thomas Ahle, we can finally release the new website, in the hope it will be useful.</p>
