<h3>Staunton 0.10 Final!</h3>
<p>This release of PyChess has been on the way for more than two years.
We have had a lot of last minute fixes since the release candidate.
A few of them for bugs that have been around a long time.
In particular there has been a lot of stabilization of CECP and UCI,
so they should now work with an even wider set of engines.
You can even run windows engines through wine.</p>
