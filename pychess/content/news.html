<p>This is great news, and we thank our great users for spreading the love, and our developers for bringing us ever better and more stable PyChess releases!</p>
<p>The BabasChess stats bot does however also show, that some distributions are very slow at delivering the latest releases to their users. This is something we notice a lot on the issue tracker, but we haven't had too much of an idea of the actual numbers.</p>

<h3>Staunton 0.10 Final!</h3>
<p>This release of PyChess has been on the way for more than two years.
We have had a lot of last minute fixes since the release candidate.
A few of them for bugs that have been around a long time.
In particular there has been a lot of stabilization of CECP and UCI,
so they should now work with an even wider set of engines.
You can even run windows engines through wine.</p>
